DIscussion/Conclusion
The original purpose of our study was to find the happiest city in the world, however we changed it to finding it within the United States because it was not feasible to have that many cities represented. We decided to just focus on the United States and chose two cities from each state. We discovered that cities with higher standards of living had sexual assaults reported more often. This data shows higher occurrences of rape whereas in smaller cities this crime goes unreported and ignored. In the happiest cities we also noticed there are more vehicle thefts. We concluded that in the happiest cities people tend to buy more expensive cars and they are more likely to get stolen. To make our data more accurate to predict the happiness in the future we added date describing the weather, rain, humidity, wind speed and sunshine of the city. As we worked on our project we learned exactly what makes a city a happy city. A cityâ€™s happiness is due not only to its crime levels but also the amount of time it takes to commute to work, the population of residents, income rate, and unemployment. After we gathered some data we noticed that Honolulu has been the happiest city for two years in a row. In 2015 and 2016 Honolulu, Hawaii was the happiest city to live in. Based on our conclusions it was the happiest city to live in because of their small population so there would be less traffic and commuting to different areas would be easier. There are less crimes in Honolulu which makes it easier for individuals to live there without fear for their safety. The added year round sunshine in this is another significant factor in the high levels of happiness among the locals.
