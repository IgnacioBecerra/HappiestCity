DIscussion/Conclusion
In the beginning we wanted to find the happiest city in the world, however we changed to just finding the happiest city in the United States because it was not feasible to have that many cities represented. So we decided to just focus on United States and we chose two cities from each state. In cities with higher standards of living, sexual assaults are reported more often. This data shows higher occurrences of rape whereas in smaller cities this crime goes unreported and ignored. In the happiest cities we also noticed there are more vehicle thefts. We concluded in the happiest cities people buy more expensive cars and they are more likely to get stolen. To make our data more accurate to predict the happiness in the future we would add the weather data, rain, humidity, wind speed and sunshine. 
 Confounds of our data 
Our data is hypothetical because it only focuses on two cities from each state, and if we had more resources and more access to other data sets we could calculate every city from every state. Also, our metrics are correlated with happiness but mathematically they are not strong predictors of happiness.
